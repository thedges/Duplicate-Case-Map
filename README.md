# Duplicate-Case-Map

Sample code that includes a Visualforce page (ArcGisTest) to use in Salesforce console that shows similar/like cases. The map has pop-up that allows you to select another case as parent which then marks current case as duplicate. Typically used in scenarios like 311 to have call center agents find duplicate cases (i.e. pink elephant on street).
